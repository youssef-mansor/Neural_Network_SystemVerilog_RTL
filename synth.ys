# Create a file named `synthesize.tcl` or `synthesize.ys` (Yosys scripts use `.ys` or `.tcl` extensions)

# Read in the top-level Verilog module and any includes
read_verilog NN.sv

# Perform generic synthesis steps:
# 1. Perform a simple synthesis using the `synth` command
#    This step will infer the necessary hardware from the Verilog description.
synth

# 2. If your design has specific constraints or a target technology (like FPGA or ASIC),
#    you can specify the target here. For example:
#   synth -top NN
# This ensures that Yosys synthesizes starting from the `NN` module.

# 3. Optionally, run `opt` for optimization (e.g., to remove unused logic):
opt

# 4. Optionally, perform a mapping to a specific target (e.g., FPGA or ASIC) if needed:
# For FPGA synthesis, you might need additional passes like `techmap` or `dfflegal`.
# For example, for ASIC synthesis, you can use:
# techmap
# dfflegal

# 5. (Optional) Write out the synthesized netlist in a desired format (e.g., Verilog, BLIF, or EDIF):
write_verilog synthesized_design.v
# Or, for BLIF format (for FPGA tools):
# write_blif synthesized_design.blif

# Optionally, write out statistics (e.g., area, logic elements) to check synthesis results:
stat

# If you have any specific constraints or other synthesis options, add them here.
